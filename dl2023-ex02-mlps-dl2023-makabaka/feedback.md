## Major Problems?
It is usually not clear at the very beginning how to use a given function in the files. It takes some time understanding the given codes.


## Helpful?
Yes. Especially we figured out how the structure of the weights and biases may change if the hidden units are different.


## Duration (hours)?

_Please make a list where every student in your group puts in the hours they used to do the complete exercise_
_Example: [5.5, 4, 7], if one of you took 5 and a half hours, one person 4 and the other 7. The order does not matter._
_This feedback will help us analyze which exercise sheets are too time-intensive._

[10, 10, 10]

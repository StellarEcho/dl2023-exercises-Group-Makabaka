## Major Problems?
The process of understanding the given code (what has already been done and how) and how to continue is important. Also not easy to transfer the understanding of the distributions into codes.


## Helpful?
Yes. We understand the principles of the distributions and some parts of python coding.


## Duration (hours)?

_Please make a list where every student in your group puts in the hours they used to do the complete exercise_
_Example: [5.5, 4, 7], if one of you took 5 and a half hours, one person 4 and the other 7. The order does not matter._
_This feedback will help us analyze which exercise sheets are too time-intensive._

[15, 15, 10]

## Other feedback?
No. Working hard in this course now.

## Major Problems?
The figure plotting is a little tricky as it needs to use the data derived from other functions. Searched for some materials for how to implement the plots like this.


## Helpful?
Yes. We look through the formulas used in the codes and get a better understanding of how to apply them.


## Duration (hours)?

_Please make a list where every student in your group puts in the hours they used to do the complete exercise_
_Example: [5.5, 4, 7], if one of you took 5 and a half hours, one person 4 and the other 7. The order does not matter._
_This feedback will help us analyze which exercise sheets are too time-intensive._

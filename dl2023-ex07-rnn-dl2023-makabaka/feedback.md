## Major Problems?
Confunsed at first how to implement the LSTM as well as the model. Some hints can be learned from the previous examples, but not very clear. Spent some time figuring out how to implement the structure of noise removal model


## Helpful?
Yes. Deeper understanding into LSTM and the network model.


## Duration (hours)?

_Please make a list where every student in your group puts in the hours they used to do the complete exercise_
_Example: [5.5, 4, 7], if one of you took 5 and a half hours, one person 4 and the other 7. The order does not matter._
_This feedback will help us analyze which exercise sheets are too time-intensive._

[9, 9, 9]

## Other feedback?
No.
